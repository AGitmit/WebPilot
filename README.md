# üåêüïπÔ∏è WebPilot

**Version:** 0.1.0  

WebPilot is an advanced, developer-focused tool designed to redefine how we control and interact with the web programmatically. Built to facilitate robust and scalable headless browser operations, WebPilot provides unmatched flexibility and control over web automation and browser management.

---

## **Overview**

WebPilot is a sophisticated tool for managing headless browser instances and performing web automation tasks. It offers a RESTful API interface, making it easy for developers to integrate powerful browser-based operations into their applications. Whether you need to automate complex web interactions, scrape data, or test web applications, WebPilot is equipped to handle it efficiently and scalably.

### **Key Features**
- **Dynamic Browser Pool Management**: Efficiently manage and scale pools of headless browser instances to optimize performance and resource usage.
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Spin up browser instances with custom configurations such as user-agent strings, geolocation, proxy settings, and more.
- **Stateful Page Sessions**: Control stateful page-sessions remotely, stored in-memory.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor browser performance metrics to ensure stability and responsiveness.
- **RESTful API**: Interact with WebPilot using a REST API for seamless integration into your workflow.

## **Core Components**

### **Browser Pool**
The browser pool dynamically manages the lifecycle of headless browser instances, ensuring optimal performance under varying loads. This component supports:
- Auto-scaling: Adjusts the number of browser instances based on demand.
- Configuration templates: Allows custom configurations for each instance.
- Efficient resource allocation: Ensures each browser instance operates within capacity to prevent performance degradation.

### **Performance Metrics**
Comprehensive metrics are collected and monitored, including:
- CPU and memory usage per browser instance.
- Active pages and overall task load.
- System-level performance indicators.

## **Use Cases**

- **Web Automation**: Automate complex workflows like filling out forms, interacting with JavaScript-heavy pages, or navigating multi-step processes.
- **Data Scraping**: Extract structured data from websites, even those protected by anti-bot mechanisms.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Perform comprehensive tests on web applications in realistic environments with varying configurations.
- **Headless Browsing**: Interact with websites programmatically without a visible browser UI.
- **Load Testing**: Simulate real-world traffic with multiple browsers and user sessions.

---

## **System Requirements**
- **Python Version**: 3.12 or higher.
- **Dependencies**: Managed using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for streamlined package management and virtual environment handling.
- **OS**: Linux-based systems are recommended for optimal compatibility with headless Chromium.
