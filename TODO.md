### üåêüïπÔ∏è WebPilot - TODO
#### Tasks
- **Exception handling**: move exception handling methods to app module (handle globally).
- **Page Actions**: expand page actions exposed via REST API.
- **Snapshots**: validate robust methods working as expected.
- **Testing**: write tests.
- **db**: implement a nosql db for storing session snapshots.
- **scaling**: finish implementing logic for scaling browser pools (based on category).
- **Browser pools logic**: user creates a pool with set configurations for the browser within the pool. and then the pool itself is what scales when a set threshold is exceeded. it is abstracted from the user. and thus the user wont care about the browsers within the pool.
- **Page functionality**: add ability to set Geo-location on page session.
- **Update .env.default**
- **LeasedBrowser**: implement is_busy() method to check if browser has any pages or idle.
- **LeasedBrowser**: implement has_capacity() method to check if browser has capacity for new page.
